## 🏗️ Project Overview
The Employee Management System is a console-based application developed in **C++**.  
It allows users to manage employee records including ID, name, department, and salary.  
The system performs CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) and stores data in binary files for persistence.

## ⚙️ Objectives
- Simplify employee data management  
- Reduce manual record-keeping errors  
- Provide fast access and modification of employee data  
- Demonstrate use of file handling in C++

## 💡 Tools & Technologies
- **Programming Language:** C++  
- **Compiler:** GCC / Turbo C++  
- **Platform:** Windows / Linux  
- **Storage:** Binary File (`employees.dat`)

## 🧭 System Workflow
1. Add Employee → Saves record in file  
2. View Employees → Displays all records  
3. Search/Edit/Delete → Modifies or removes data by ID  
4. Exit → Ends session safely

## 📈 Output Example
 EMPLOYEE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
1.Add Employee

2.View Employees

3.Search Employee

4.Edit Employee

5.Delete Employee

6.Exit

## 🚀 Future Scope
- Implement database storage (MySQL)  
- Add GUI for better interactivity  
- Integrate payroll automation  
- Create analytics for performance tracking
